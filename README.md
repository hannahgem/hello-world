**What I hope to accompish in Web Design?**

I hope to gain the necessary skills to be able to create websites that are usable for everyone. I had frustrating experiences with websites being difficult to use and read. I want to understand what good design techniques are involved in creating websites and how to make these websites accessible for as many people as possible. For example, how do we create a website that can help people with disabilities such as vision impairment? Would my website be usable on a mobile device and a computer? My main goal that I hope to accomplish in Web Design is being able to create websites that are easy to use and understand for everyone.
